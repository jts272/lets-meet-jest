# lets-meet-jest

A repository to learn about the JavaScript testing framework Jest.

## Concepts covered:

- Installation (node_modules folder in workspace)
- File/folder structure for test files
- Actual test function format with Jest directives
- Red-green-refactor
- Adding additional tests
- Creating small mock DOM fragments
- Importing entire HTML files for mock DOM testing

## Coding environment:

In addition to installation with `npm install --save-dev jest@26.6.3`, this
command was also used to install `eslint-plugin-jest`. Addition config can be
seen here: https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest

Furthermore, the Jest VS Code extension was installed to aid testing UX during
development.
